# 02_Algorithms

## Definition

An algorithm is a **step-by-step procedure** or set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task. Algorithms make use of data structures to solve problems efficiently.

## Characteristics

- **Input/Output**: Takes input values and produces defined outputs
- **Finite**: Should have finite number of steps
- **Definite**: Each step should be clear and precise
- **Correctness**: Should produce the desired output for all possible inputs

## Efficiency Measures

An algorithm's efficiency is measured by:

- **Time Complexity**: Processing time required
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage required

## Types of Algorithms

- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms

## Algorithmic Approaches

- **Brute Force**: Trying all possible solutions until the correct one is found
- **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them independently
- **Backtracking**: Building solutions incrementally and abandoning solutions that fail to satisfy constraints

## Representation

Algorithms can be represented using:

- **Flowchart**: Visual representation of algorithm flow
- **Pseudocode**: Written description of algorithm steps in plain language
