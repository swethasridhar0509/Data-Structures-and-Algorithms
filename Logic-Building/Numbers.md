# Numbers

### What are Numbers?

- **Numbers** are symbols used to count, measure, and perform calculations.
- **Ex:** 2 cups, 3/4, and 1:50 PM.

### Number System

- Base, digits
- **Face Value** - The digit itself, irrespective of position.
- **Place Value** - Depends on the base and position of the digit.
- Place of a digit = digit x (base) ^ position.

## Decimal Number System

- Base - 10.
- Has 10 digits - 0, 1, 2, 3,  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Place value** - powers of 10 ($10^0, 10^1, 10^2$…. ).
- **Use case:** Humans use this system for day-to-day calculations.
- **Ex:** 452, The place value of 4 - 400.

$$
(4×10^2)+(5×10^1)+(2×10^0)
=400+50+2= 452
$$

## Binary Number System

- Base - 2.
- Has 2 digits - 0 and 1
- **Place value** - powers of 2 ($2^0, 2^1, 2^2$…. ).
- **Use case:** Computer understands only 0s and 1s.
- **Ex:** $1011_2$

$$
(1×2^3) + (0×2^2) + (1×2^1) + (1×2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11_{10}
$$

## Octal Number System

- Base - 8.
- Has 8 digits - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- **Place value** - powers of 8 ($8^0, 8^1, 8^2$…. ).
- **Use case:** Linux for file Permissions
- **Ex:** $573_8$

## Hexadecimal Number System

- Base - 16.
- Has 16 digits - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15.
- **Place value** - powers of 16 ($16^0, 16^1, 16^2$…. ).
- **Use case:** Represents Colors. `#FF1021`
- **Ex: $2F3_{16}$**

$$
(2×16^2) + (F×16^1) + (3×16^0) = 512 + 240 + 3 = 755_{10}
$$

## Classification of Numbers

1. **Natural Numbers:** Counting numbers (1 - 9)
2. **Whole numbers:** {0 and Natural Numbers}. 
    - Every natural number is a whole number.
    - 0 is not a natural number.
3. **Positive Numbers:** Numbers greater than 0, **Ex:** 1, 2…
4. **Negative Numbers:** Numbers less than 0, **Ex:** -1, -2… 
5. **Integers:** Numbers whose fractional part is 0. Includes positive, zero, and negative numbers. **Ex:** -1, 0, 10
6. **Rational (or) Fractional Numbers** - Any number that can be written as a fraction p/q , where q ≠ 0.
    - All **natural numbers, whole numbers, and Integers** are **rational numbers** because it can be written as a **fraction**
    - Includes Repeating/Terminating decimals
    - **Ex:** 3 / 4 = 0.75, -2 = -2 / 1
7. **Real Numbers** - All numbers on the number line. Includes rational and irrational numbers.
